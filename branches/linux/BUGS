- When you quit the game, it segfaults
- The cursor colours are messed up
- The background colour of the textbox controls is cyan (I think this is due to
	my changes on line 497 of ui/aui_textfield.cpp, where the colour used to be
	'0xffff', and I changed this to 'SDL_MapRGB(SDLsurf->format, 0, 0xff, 0xff)'
	-- that being my best guess as to what was in fact intended.  It is clear now
	that I was wrong, but I don't know what colour is wanted)
- No text ever appears in textbox controls, either from the source or from
	typing into them
- Something in the CD code generates an 'Operation not permitted' message
	whenever there is a CD in the drive, and a 'No medium found' message when
	there isn't (I suspect the CD music-related code)
- On the credits screen the flames are framed by black boxes, rather than the
	background showing through -- this is probably some kind of alpha channel
	problem
- The intro movie doesn't play
- It is necessary to click somewhere after the 'Loading' dialog to reach the
	main menu
- No screen resolution options appear in the graphics options
- I get a message saying 'open /dev/sequencer: No such device' during startup,
	even though /dev/sequencer does exist on my machine
- When trying to start a network game, the game freezes whilst searching for
	servers and is very difficult to kill
- Upon cancelling the 'Load game' dialog, the game segfaults
