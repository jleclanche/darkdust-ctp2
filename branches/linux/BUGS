- When you quit the game, it segfaults
- The text in text controls is the wrong size (see HACK message in
  ui/aui_common/aui_textfield.cpp)
- Something in the CD code generates an 'Operation not permitted' message
	whenever there is a CD in the drive, and a 'No medium found' message when
	there isn't (I suspect the CD music-related code)
- The intro movie doesn't play
- It is necessary to click somewhere after the 'Loading' dialog to reach the
	main menu
- No screen resolution options appear in the graphics options
- I get a message saying 'open /dev/sequencer: No such device' during startup,
	even though /dev/sequencer does exist on my machine
- When trying to start a network game, the game freezes whilst searching for
	servers and is very difficult to kill
- There are frequent minor graphics glitches, including:
  - The cursor colours are messed up
  - On the credits screen the flames are framed by black boxes, rather than the
    background showing through -- this is probably some kind of alpha channel
    problem
  - The drawing of map tiles isn't working properly
  - Units tend to vanish immediately after being drawn
  - Pixels have a tendency to be shifted around by the cursor - I feel this is
    another symptom of whatever problem is causing the cursor colours to be
    mesed up.
  - The numbers along the path that shows when a unit is being given a move
    order are missing
- The game uses a lot of CPU all the time
- The window of the game has no title
- Keyboard input doesn't work
- Either saving doesn't work or loading fails to find savegames
